                <p>
                Nowadays, technology allows us to create highly realistic images of faces that do not belong to real humans. In this demo you will be able to test your ability to distinguish between real and synthetic face images generated by some of the newest Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
                <!--For additional details, please follow the link to the <b>paper</b> at the end of the demonstration.-->

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>
                In this study we will show you several images that are either real or synthetic. Each image will appear at the center of the screen for <b>3 seconds</b> and then disappear. You will be asked to say how much you agree with the statement <b>"This image is synthetic"</b> on a scale from 1 = "Completely disagree" to 7 = "Completely agree".
                Some images might be trivial to judge, however most of them are challenging to evaluate. Even very experienced people do not always find the correct answer, so simply trust your guts and keep going. Before proceeding with the actual task, there will be a familiarization phase where you can get accustomed to the task and the type of images.
